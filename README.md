# 🛒 ShopiQuick – Class 8 Project

This website was built during **Class 8** as part of a school ICT competition. The challenge was to solve a real-world problem faced by our communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. While still a beginner at the time, I took a problem-solving approach to coding and conceptualized a hyperlocal delivery solution taking inspiration from quick commerce which was just getting the hype.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

During the COVID-19 lockdowns, **small local vendors** — kirana stores, vegetable sellers, milk and bread vendors, and other small businesses — struggled to stay afloat. At the same time, **e-commerce giants** saw massive growth. Customers also faced issues such as:

- Delayed deliveries
- Lack of personalization
- High minimum order values

## 💡 Our Solution

We proposed a **micro-shopping platform** that focuses on a **10 km radius** hyperlocal area. The goal was to digitize and connect the unorganized sector while offering customers:

- Rapid deliveries (within 1 hour)
- No minimum order requirements
- Humanized shopping experience
- Multiple payment options (including COD or post-delivery payment)

The website simulates the platform interface, with **tabs for various services and shops**, allowing users to explore offerings and place orders.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML & CSS:** Used for structuring and styling the website
- No backend used — this was a **front-end prototype/demo** designed to showcase the concept


## 🚀 Features (Conceptual)

- 📦 Delivery within an hour
- 🛍️ Order from your nearest kirana or vendor
- 🧾 No minimum order size
- 💵 Pay on delivery or later
- 🧑‍🌾 Empowering small vendors through digital tools

## 🎯 Impact Vision

The idea was ahead of its time — bringing **quick commerce** to neighborhoods by leveraging **local vendor networks** instead of centralized warehouses. It combined **social impact** with **tech innovation**, especially at a time when communities needed it the most.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

This was created in **Class 8**, back when I was still exploring the basics of web development. It was one of my early experiments where I tried to combine **coding with real-world problem solving**. Projects like these helped shape my passion for **tech, entrepreneurship, and user-centered design**.
